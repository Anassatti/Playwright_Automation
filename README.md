# Playwright_Automation

**What is Playwright in automation? Playwright is a Node. js library to automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API**

Playwright can

Cross-browser. Playwright supports all modern rendering engines including Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox.

Cross-platform. Test on Windows, Linux, and macOS, locally or on CI, headless or headed.

Cross-language. Use the Playwright API in TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, .NET, Java.

Test Mobile Web. Native mobile emulation of Google Chrome for Android and Mobile Safari. The same rendering engine works on your Desktop and in the Cloud.

Auto-wait. Playwright waits for elements to be actionable prior to performing actions. It also has a rich set of introspection events. The combination of the two eliminates the need for artificial timeouts - the primary cause of flaky tests.

Web-first assertions. Playwright assertions are created specifically for the dynamic web. Checks are automatically retried until the necessary conditions are met.

Tracing. Configure test retry strategy, capture execution trace, videos, screenshots to eliminate flakes.

**Tools I used in this project**

Playwright

IDE: Visual Studio Code.

Progreammin Language: Java Script.

Automation Framework: Page object model.

**About The project**

The single-window system or single-window concept is a trade facilitation concept which allows an international (cross-border)trader to submit information to a single agency, rather than having to deal with multiple agencies in multiple locations to obtain the necessary papers, permits, and clearances to complete their import or export processes. There is an obvious time saving benefit to the single window system. The concept is recognised by organisations such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and its Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business, World Customs Organization (WCO), the United Nations Network of Experts for Paperless Trade and Transport in Asia and the Pacific and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

**Visual Testig**

Part of the project there will be visual testing, below are the full definistion of it

**What is Visual Testing?**
Visual testing, a method of software testing, evaluates the visual fidelity of your user interface (UI) or graphical user interface (GUI). Visual tests tackle the look of your application and help you capture defects that other types of tests might miss.

**Why I implement visual testing**

Visual testing captures defects that other types of UI tests cannot, for example there are limitation of functional are:

•	Pixel-by-pixel differences

•	Alignment shifts

•	Page layout

•	Rendering problems

•	Element overlap

•	Responsive layout

•	Font differences

•	Color differences

**Visual comparisons**

Playwright Test includes the ability to produce and visually compare screenshots using await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot(). On first execution, Playwright test will generate reference screenshots. Subsequent runs will compare against the reference.
